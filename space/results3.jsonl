{"mission_name": "Aeolus ", "mission_descrition": "Aeolus was the first satellite mission to acquire profiles of Earth’s wind on a global scale. These observations improved weather forecasts and climate models. The Aeolus satellite carried just one large instrument – a Doppler wind lidar that measured the winds sweeping around our planet. Surpassing scientific expectations and exceeding its planned life in orbit, the mission ended on 28 July 2023."}

{"mission_name": "Webb ", "mission_descrition": "The James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) is the next great space science observatory following Hubble, designed to answer outstanding questions about the Universe and to make breakthrough discoveries in all fields of astronomy. Webb will see farther into our origins: from the formation of stars and planets, to the birth of the first galaxies in the early Universe. Webb is an international partnership between NASA, ESA and CSA. The telescope launched on an Ariane 5 from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana."}
{"mission_name": "Vigil ", "mission_descrition": "ESA Vigil will be the first of its kind. By keeping an eagle eye on the 'side' of the Sun, the spacecraft will stream a constant feed of near real-time data on potentially hazardous solar activity, before it rolls into view from Earth. The mission will give us advance warning of oncoming solar storms and therefore more time to protect spacecraft in orbit, infrastructure on the ground and explorers now and in the future, unshielded by Earth's magnetic field and vulnerable to our star's violent outbursts. Formerly known as the \"Lagrange mission\", ESA Vigil takes its name from the Latin ‘vigilis exceptus’ meaning sentry, and also ‘vigilia’ meaning wakefulness and the act of keeping a devoted watch."}

{"mission_name": "Space Rider ", "mission_descrition": "Space Rider is an uncrewed robotic laboratory about the size of two minivans. After launch on Vega-C it will stay in low orbit for about two months. Experiments inside its cargo bay will allow technology demonstration and benefit research in pharmaceutics, biomedicine, biology and physical science. At the end of its mission, Space Rider will return to Earth with its payloads and land on a runway to be unloaded and refurbished for another flight."}
