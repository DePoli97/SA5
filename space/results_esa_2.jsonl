{"mission_name": "Aeolus ", "mission_descrition": "Aeolus was the first satellite mission to acquire profiles of Earth’s wind on a global scale. These observations improved weather forecasts and climate models. The Aeolus satellite carried just one large instrument – a Doppler wind lidar that measured the winds sweeping around our planet. Surpassing scientific expectations and exceeding its planned life in orbit, the mission ended on 28 July 2023."}

{"mission_name": "Altius ", "mission_descrition": "The Atmospheric Limb Tracker for Investigation of the Upcoming Stratosphere (Altius) mission carries a high-resolution spectral imager and uses a limb-sounding technique to deliver profiles of ozone and other trace gases in the upper atmosphere to support services such as weather forecasting, and to monitor long-term trends. Altius is developed within ESA’s Earth Watch programme and financed mainly by Belgium with contributions from Canada, Luxembourg and Romania."}
{"mission_name": "Arctic Weather Satellite ", "mission_descrition": "The Arctic Weather Satellite mission will provide frequent coverage of Earth for improved nowcasting and numerical weather prediction. "}
{"mission_name": "Ariane ", "mission_descrition": "With its inaugural launch in 1979, ESA’s Ariane programme established Europe’s independent access to space for institutional, scientific and commercial missions. As the size of satellites grew, Ariane 1 gave way to the more powerful versions 2, 3, and 4. From 1996, Ariane 5 served as one of the world's premier heavy-lift rockets, orbiting single or multiple payloads and sending a series of iconic scientific missions to deep space. Ariane 6 adds a further dimension of versatility and cost-efficiency. "}
